Apologies if this will be a bit of a ""brain dump"" on what I'm thinking about at the moment...    	I've had one, fabulous, fulfilling & rewarding job in my life, having signed up to join AG way back in my 2nd year of university;  	I still get a buzz from AG and enjoy the vast majority of what I do as a senior partner in a successful international law firm, but I'm turning 50 next year and I didn't plan to only ever have had one job in my life, so looking ahead I would want to have explored & tried some other things for the next 10 years of my professional life, whilst hopefully I'm still energetic, fit & healthy;   	I feel that I've been lucky enough to achieve a lot professionally, so I'm not sitting here with an unquenched burning desire to prove anything to anybody, which I probably did when I was younger;   	equally I'm not ready to put my slippers on, and am comfortable that I've built a set skills & senior experience that means I can do some interesting and successful work in another channel;  	I'm lucky & privileged enough to be in a position that I can make some professional life choices, but as a committed AG lifer I find it extremely hard to visualise what that might be or look like outside AG, and how I make that happen;  	but I've gone ahead and taken the leap anyway (as I otherwise I know it probably wouldn't happen);  	12 months ago I took the decision to make the change next year at the age of 50 (i) as I want it to feel more like launching a proper second career and not just an 'add on' to 27 years of being a private practice corporate lawyer, or just being a 'keep busy/stopgap' until retirement; and (ii) I think there's probably more opportunities & time for me to change tack when at 50 than say at 55;  	I'm extremely proud of a successful career at AG, so I also wanted to leave that in the right way, at a time of my choosing, and I'd rather risk that being a few years too early rather than a few years too late;   	the last six months at AG have been more focused on transitioning various roles within AG so that I know they all are safely 'squared away', so that I will be leaving in the 'right way' to give me the head and gut comfort that I've done the right thing by the business, so that its now OK & the right time for me to focus on life post AG;  	I finish at AG in May next year, so for the next 6 months I'll be more out in the market telling clients & my network about my plans, which I intend to use to help form and shape ideas on what to do next, and hopefully even create some opportunities;    	inevitably there's a bit of me that sometimes worries about why I have chosen to give up a successful, secure, well paid career that I still enjoy, especially now that the world has gone up-side down with the pandemic, but that's only a small nagging worry, and for the most part I'm very excited and I back myself to land on something interesting to do next;    	I wouldn't ever be a private practice lawyer anywhere other than AG;   	I could perhaps explore an in-house legal role in a sector or business that interests me, and that may be a sensible/more achievable transition move, but I don't want to limit my thinking just to that;  	I like the idea of maybe 2 or 3 different roles, rather than one full time role;  	I want to use my skills I've built up, but ideally I'd also like to do something ""non-City"";  	we have a house in London and Berkshire, and our family life will be based around London for the next 3 years anyway whilst our youngest finishes school, so work should fit around that (i.e. I wouldn't suddenly be looking for non UK roles)  	from a financial point of view I've almost come to the end of paying 4 kids through private school, and from next year our financial position becomes v different with only school fees for the youngest; as a family we're lucky enough to be financially very sound but (sadly!) its not as if I can retire on the yacht quite yet (!) so I'll definitely still need some money coming in, but it doesn't need to be at the levels of an AG equity partner;  	Ideally I might perhaps want to work 4 days a week to allow a bit more free time;  	initial/early stage thinking is maybe a mix/portfolio made up of a 'main' role as a director/senior mentor/consultant (which was paid ok), which would enable me to do a role in something that I'd just love to be involved in for its own sake (immersive theatre & sport/rugby are passions for example); and then maybe even a smaller role for a charity or a cause I'm attracted to (I'm a fly fisherman so am thinking about river conservation);  	I've enjoyed senior leadership roles and am strong with building and incentivising teams & strategy & people management, so it would probably be that kind of team environment rather than me going it alone;  	I'm been an M&A guy for 27 years, so probably have skills and am drawn more towards growth, management & strategy rather than say plc compliance;  	as a corporate lawyer I've been lucky enough to have worked across all sorts of sectors, and as a senior lawyer with various leadership & management roles within the business to have undertaken a breadth of roles & tasks – which I'm conscious I need to sit down & map out in full;   	finally ideally I'd look to have some time off next summer, say 3 or 4 months; I finish at AG in May 2021, so ideally might be looking to start the new world in Sept 2021, so I've got a year from now to work out what that is!    Sorry this is a very much an unstructured thread, and all still first stage thinking that needs to be shaped and most likely will change & develop, but I'm conscious that I've got to start that process from somewhere so its helpful to get this down on paper as a starter!
